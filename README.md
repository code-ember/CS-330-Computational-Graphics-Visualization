What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? The design skills helped me design software that improved my programming skills with using C++ in order to create numerous 2D objects with a 3D view set. Also, I did not thank that I would need to relay on so much math formulas that I learned two years ago to calculate the x, y and z axles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What design process did you follow for your project work? The design process I used to manage the completion of the final project in module seven is following these five steps. First, I worded on is the creating my objects with calculating the x, y and z coordinating. Second, I worded on is the texture and wring each texture per object in order to load them. Third, I added the dictionary for each major sections in the code in order to keep track of everything. Fourth, I added the lighting to create a visualization of my 3D scene. Finally, I added the camera ability for all around navigation of my 3D scene.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? I felt that the design approach helped me think outside of my confuted zone and it led to some great ideas. Also, I modified my final project repeatedly by trial and error which helped me create objects, functions, buffers, and other inputs that speed up the process at the end.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I created a storyboard to help me plan out every step of my 3D scene and it helps improve all my ideas that were stuck in my head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did iteration factor into your development? The iterative process begins with a series of steps that is repeated over again, which helps improve the base of the project. Also, the iterative process is like the waterfall and agile methods which improves on the result of each cycle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion? Every milestone that I went through helped me out by tracking my overall progress toward the end of each module in order to move on to the next task in the modules.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? The time I spent in this class learning about graphics and visualizations, I can say that my knowledge and skills from programming with OpenGL and C++ really have grown. Also, my math skills have enhanced a lot as well. As I am approaching the end of my bachelor’s degree, this expressly helps my growth and knowledge as a programmer.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? Creating visualizations when displaying results of data since a lot of people depend on data to make decisions and by telling a story with the data can help build 3D plans to help others make decisions. This class has opened my eyes into how computational graphics and visualizations can have a big impacted on myself and others.
