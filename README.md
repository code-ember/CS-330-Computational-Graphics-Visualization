## Computational Graphics and Visualization
Welcome to my CS-330 project, where I delve into the world of computational graphics and visualization. Throughout this project, I have gained valuable skills and insights that have enhanced my programming abilities, design processes, and overall approach to software development. Here’s an overview of my journey:

### New Design Skills: 
This project has honed my ability to design software using C++, enabling me to create intricate 2D objects with a 3D perspective. Additionally, I’ve rediscovered the importance of mathematical formulas in calculating x, y, and z coordinates.

### Design Process: 
My design process consisted of five key steps. First, I created objects by calculating their coordinates. Next, I worked on texturing each object to ensure they loaded correctly. Then, I added a dictionary for major code sections to keep everything organized. After that, I incorporated lighting to bring my 3D scene to life. Finally, I added camera functionality for comprehensive navigation.

### Future Applications: 
The design approach used in this project pushed me out of my comfort zone, leading to innovative ideas. Through trial and error, I repeatedly modified the final project, creating objects, functions, buffers, and other inputs that streamlined the process.

### Development Strategies: 
I employed a storyboard to meticulously plan each step of my 3D scene, helping to clarify and enhance the ideas that were initially in my head.

### Iteration in Development: 
The iterative process, akin to both waterfall and agile methodologies, involved repeating a series of steps to refine the project’s foundation. This cyclical improvement led to better outcomes with each iteration.

### Evolving Code Development: 
Each milestone tracked my progress and guided me towards completing the project. These checkpoints ensured that I could move on to subsequent tasks efficiently.

### Educational Pathway: 
The knowledge and skills I’ve acquired in computational graphics and visualizations have significantly grown, especially in programming with OpenGL and C++. As I near the completion of my bachelor’s degree, this experience has been instrumental in my development as a programmer.

### Professional Pathway: 
Creating visualizations to display data results is crucial, as many people rely on data for decision-making. This project has shown me how computational graphics and visualizations can tell compelling stories with data, aiding in decision-making processes. It has truly opened my eyes to the impact these skills can have on my future professional endeavors.
